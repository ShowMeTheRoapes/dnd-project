# *Dungeons and Dragons* Character Creator

This application is currently being built to be an executable desktop application that will aid in the initial creation of characters for one of our favorite tabletop games, *Dungeons and Dragons*.

Goals For This Project
----------------------

One of the most confusing processes of *Dungeons and Dragons*, for veteran players and newcomers alike, is the chracter creation process. There are so many different aspects of a character to consider, and when it is all presented at once it can be quite overwhelming.

With this application, we are hoping to subvert some of this complexity by giving the user a step-by-step, easy to follow method of creating a character for the first time.

Where We Are Now
----------------------

Currently, we are still quite young in the development process. We are developing this application as a learning experience, so it is going rather slowly as we teach ourselves through the different caveats and complications of application development in our spare time. 

We'll let you know as soon as we get to a working prototype!
